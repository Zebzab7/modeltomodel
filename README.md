# DCR graph locations
The locations of the public datasets provided from DCRSolutions: 

src/main/java/beamline/dcr/testsoftware/publicrepodataset/model<model_num> 

## Graphs used for "Applications of Model-to-Model Similarity Metrics to Capture Process Behavior in Declarative Models"
Section 5.1 depicts 4 sub-plots in which the following baselines models were utilized:

Top left plot: 89  
Top right plot: 5047  
Bottom right plot: 7188  
Bottom left plot: 7262  

Model 7188 was also used in section 5.2.2.

## Research paper example
The DCR graph modeling the process of writing a research paper used in sections 5.2.3 and 5.3 is located in:

src/main/java/beamline/dcr/testsoftware/driftedmodels/ResearchPaperExample/ResearchPaper<version_number> 

Where <version_number> is each of the graph snapshots. Version numbers are 1 through 12), 1 being the original graph before any changes are applied.
